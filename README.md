# Evol-SNN
Evolutionary and Adaptive Evolutionary spiking neuron models for spiking CNN and FNN.

This repository is used as the experiment code for the paper "Zheng Xu, Yuzhen Niu, Ying Han, Anguo Zhang*, Wei Zhu. *Evolutionary Neuron Model for Fast-Response Spiking Neural Networks*".

## How to Use
All the main entries are put at the root directionary.

1. Train

*train_cnn.m* and *train_fnn.m* are for training the analog ANNs (CNN and FNN), respectively.

2. Test

*main_scnn.m* and *main_sfnn.m* are for converting and test the spiking networks (SCNN and SFNN), respectively.
